                Hitting President Trump’s 100 days in his second presidency, Trump has rolled out more attacks on the environment than his entire first term, according to The Guardian’s recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/01/trump-air-climate-pollution-regulation-100-days">reporting.</a>

                Despite the radical changes to U.S. climate and environment policy, Maryland legislators and local representatives expressed in recent years aims to conserve and improve green spaces and land conservation in the area, according to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.

                Though improvements can be seen on a statewide level, several low-income and disadvantaged communities disproportionately receive benefits, whether resources are environmental or financial.

            <h3>How we analyzed Frederick County</h3>

            <p>
                In this story, reporters examined several areas in Frederick County, Maryland, an area with vast green space, and their demographics and health statistics to investigate access to green spaces and possible correlations to health outcomes across the county. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Black and Hispanic communities are <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/disparities-chartbook/">more likely to experience poverty</a> than white and Asian communities in the United States, often experiencing ongoing systemic factors including disparities in socioeconomic resources like education, healthcare and employment in comparison to their racial counterparts.
            </p>

            <p>
                Around 22% of the Frederick County population is Black and Hispanic, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Using <a href="https://censusreporter.org/profiles/05000US24021-frederick-county-md/">bureau data</a> and <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/PLACES-Local-Data-for-Better-Health-Census-Tract-D/cwsq-ngmh/data_preview">local data</a> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reporters observed several correlations within the county, measuring several factors including census tract (for both demographics and geographic green space data), race and ethnicity, median household income, poverty rates, obesity rates, lack of physical activity rates and green spaces access (rated poor, moderate, or rich). 
            </p>

            <p>
                For the purpose of this investigation, green spaces are defined as visible green areas such as scattered parks, sports fields, tree-lined, neighborhoods, forests and wooded areas. Reporters assessed green space access by visually analyzing each census tract on Google Maps, noting the presence of open fields, parks and other outdoor recreation areas. 
            </p>

        <div class="container-fluid section-charts">
            <h3>Green space for whom?</h3>
            <p>
                To begin, there was a moderate positive correlation between median household income and access to green space. Below is a chart demonstrating such a correlation, with the color darkness corresponding to the level of green space access (light color = poor, medium green = moderate, dark green = rich). 
            </p>
    
            <div class="col-3">
                <p>
                    This data shows how areas with higher household incomes are more likely to have varied and richer access to green spaces than those with lower incomes. This can also be attributed to the tendency for urban areas to house lower-income communities and therefore live in areas with less greenery.

            <h3>More green, better health</h3>
    
            <p>
                Health factors like obesity rates and no leisure-time physical activity had a strong correlation to the access to green space in the county, suggesting that in Frederick County, green space plays a large part in the health of the community.  
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Earlier this year, a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-72008-8#citeas">study</a> released Earth observation data that found being close to green spaces improves psychological and physical health.
